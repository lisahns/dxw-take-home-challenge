User stories:

    When the user first loads the application, they are presented with a free text search
    box
    When they search for an acronym, the application displays the full organisation
    name for that acronym if one exists
    If no such acronym exists, an appropriate message is displayed
    An autocomplete is available on the search box, so that as a user begins to type
    acronyms that match the letters they entered are presented in a dropdown
    Partial matching is available (e.g. if a user searches for “DC”, results are returned for
    both “DCMS” and “DCLG”)
